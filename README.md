# Universal Timer Library SMT Project
An update to the Universal Timer Project with a couple of new libraries and thoughts on 3v working

### Free coupons for SMT assembly - just pay for the components

### And congratulations to JLCPCB who won the **Maker of Merit Prize** at the Maker Faire Rome

The **Universal Timer board**, from JLCPCB, with the SMT components already assembled, is here! I fitted the remainder of the through-hole components, wrote a simple sketch and voila! My toothbrush timer was done. **Or was it?**

We take a look at what's going on **when running the board at 3v**. Am I going deaf or are we being duped about so-called 3v beepers? I found it too quiet but there are a potential solutions avaialble, including using a **bigger battery** pack. Hmm. Or a **software solution** which I'll demo in a future video (link below).

We take a look at a **great Timer library** from Bruno Calou that gives us a simple way to execute a function in a repeatable fashion (link below). We cover **callback routines** and **lamda functions** too, all very easy and very powerful.

I've got **too many PCBs for this project** so it's time to give some away. If you're up for a bit of SMD soldering ask for the RED board, but I do have pre-assembled boards too - **See the PINNED COMMENT under the video before requesting anything please!**
